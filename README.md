# Interpretable ML Trading Bot

A machine learning trading system with a focus on model interpretability and market regime awareness.

## Overview

This trading bot implements a complete machine learning pipeline for trading strategy development with a focus on:

1. **Interpretable Models** - Uses transparent models like logistic regression and tree-based models to ensure trading decisions can be understood
2. **Feature Importance Analysis** - Tracks which features drive predictions over time and across different market regimes
3. **Market Regime Detection** - Automatically detects market regimes (trending, mean-reverting, volatile) and adapts models accordingly
4. **Performance Visualization** - Provides detailed visualizations of model performance and feature contributions

```

## Quick Start

### 1. Prepare your data

Place your price data CSV files in the `data/` directory. The files should have OHLCV columns.

### 2. Configure parameters

Adjust the `config.json` file to set your model parameters, feature settings, and backtest configuration.

### 3. Train models

```bash
python -m trading_bot.main --mode train --config config.json
```

This will:
- Load the market data
- Generate technical features 
- Train interpretable ML models
- Generate feature importance visualizations
- Create a performance dashboard

### 4. Run backtest

```bash
python -m trading_bot.main --mode backtest --config config.json
```

This will:
- Use the trained models to generate trading signals
- Calculate performance metrics
- Generate trade explanations
- Create a performance dashboard

### 5. View dashboard only

```bash
python -m trading_bot.main --mode dashboard --config config.json
```

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains all parameters for the system:

```json
{
    "output_dir": "./output",
    "data_sources": {
        "spy": {
            "path": "./data/spy_daily.csv",
            "index_col": "date"
        }
    },
    "feature_engineering": {
        "include_technicals": true,
        "ta_feature_sets": ["momentum", "trend", "volatility", "volume"],
        "detect_market_regime": true
    },
    "model_trainer": {
        "model_algorithm": "random_forest",
        "n_estimators": 100,
        "calculate_shap": true
    },
    "models": [
        {
            "name": "spy_direction",
            "type": "classification",
            "data_source": "spy",
            "target_horizon": 5,
            "threshold": 0.01,
            "use_regime_models": true
        }
    ],
    "backtest": {
        "model_name": "spy_direction",
        "data_source": "spy",
        "test_size": 0.2
    }
}
```

## Feature Interpretation

For each trade, the system provides feature-level explanations that help you understand what drove the model's decision:

```
Trade on 2023-05-01 decision: BUY with 78.5% confidence. Market regime was trending.
This prediction was driven by: 
  - rsi_14 (68.5) with positive influence of 0.324
  - macd_hist (0.85) with positive influence of 0.219  
  - bb_width_20 (1.32) with negative influence of 0.112
```

## Market Regimes

The system automatically detects four market regimes:

1. **Trending** - Strong directional movement with momentum
2. **Mean-reverting** - Oscillating price action around a central value
3. **High volatility** - Large price swings with elevated uncertainty
4. **Random walk** - No clear pattern identifiable

Specialized models are trained for each regime when enough data is available.

## Visualization Dashboard

The system creates an interactive dashboard with:

- Performance metrics by timeframe and market regime
- Feature importance visualizations
- Feature stability analysis
- Trade explanations with feature contributions
- Cumulative P&L tracking

Access the dashboard by opening `output/visualizations/index.html` in your browser after running training or backtesting.

## Extending the System

To add new models or features:

1. **New Features**: Extend the `FeatureEngineering` class with additional methods
2. **New Models**: Add model configurations to `config.json`
3. **Custom Analysis**: Extend the `TradeAnalyzer` class for custom performance metrics

# Trading Bot

A comprehensive trading bot system with machine learning capabilities, backtesting, and dashboard visualization.

## üöÄ Quick Start

To get started with the Trading Bot:

1. Clone the repository
2. Run the setup script:

```bash
# Make the script executable if needed
chmod +x run_streamlit.sh

# Run the dashboard
./run_streamlit.sh
```

The script will:
- Create a virtual environment if needed
- Install all required dependencies
- Check for commonly missing packages
- Launch the Streamlit dashboard

## üì¶ Manual Installation

If you prefer to set up manually:

```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the dashboard
streamlit run app.py
```

## üß© System Components

The Trading Bot consists of several modules:

- **Data Providers**: Fetch market data from various sources
- **Strategy Library**: Collection of trading strategies 
- **Backtesting Engine**: Test strategies on historical data
- **ML Models**: Machine learning models for prediction and optimization
- **Dashboard**: Web interface for monitoring and control
- **Risk Management**: Tools for position sizing and risk control

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Issues and Solutions

### Missing Dependencies

If you encounter dependency errors, ensure you're running in the virtual environment and install the specific package:

```bash
pip install flask pandas yfinance streamlit
```

### Module Not Found Errors

The system has interdependencies between modules. If you see a "module not found" error, it's likely because:

1. A required module isn't installed (use `pip install`)
2. You're not running the script from the project root directory
3. Your Python path doesn't include the project directory

### Import Issues

If you see import errors like:
```
ImportError: cannot import name 'DataSourceInterface' from 'trading_bot.core.interfaces'
```

This is usually because the interface classes were renamed or moved. The current interface names are:
- `DataProvider` (was previously `DataSourceInterface`)
- `IndicatorInterface`
- `StrategyInterface`
- `SignalInterface`

## Usage

### Quick Start

Run a backtest using the default configuration:

```bash
python run_backtest.py
```

### Custom Configuration

Create a JSON configuration file (e.g., `my_config.json`):

```json
{
    "initial_capital": 100000.0,
    "position_size": 0.2,
    "commission": 0.001,
    "stop_loss_pct": 0.05,
    "take_profit_pct": 0.1,
    "symbols": ["AAPL", "MSFT", "GOOGL", "AMZN", "TSLA"],
    "start_date": "2022-01-01",
    "end_date": "2023-01-01",
    "strategy": "sma_crossover",
    "strategy_params": {
        "sma_crossover": {
            "short_window": 20,
            "long_window": 50
        }
    }
}
```

Run the backtest with your configuration:

```bash
python run_backtest.py --config my_config.json
```

### Compare All Strategies

Run backtests for all available strategies and compare their performance:

```bash
python run_backtest.py --all
```

## Directory Structure

- `trading/`: Core trading modules
  - `backtester.py`: Backtester implementation
  - `data/`: Data fetching modules
    - `alpha_vantage_fetcher.py`: Alpha Vantage API client
- `results/`: Backtest results (JSON files and plots)
- `run_backtest.py`: Command-line interface script

## Customization

You can easily add new strategies by extending the backtester module. The system is designed to be modular and extensible.

### Adding a New Strategy

Create a new method in `Backtester` class that generates signals according to your strategy, then update the corresponding sections in `run_backtest.py`.

## Performance Considerations

- Alpha Vantage has API rate limits (typically 5 calls per minute for free tier)
- Data is cached locally to reduce API calls
- Running backtests on multiple symbols can be time-consuming
- Consider using a smaller symbol set for initial testing
